# Transformer Simulation with MATLAB

This repository contains a physics project focused on **transformers**, developed by a group of five students.  
The project simulates and analyzes several key concepts in electrical physics using **MATLAB**.

## üîå Project Overview
The main topics covered in this project are:
- **Power loss** in transformers  
- **Transformer efficiency**  
- Effects of **primary and secondary windings**  

The purpose of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of how transformers work and how efficiency can be calculated and improved.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **MATLAB** (for simulation and visualization)  
- Physics concepts related to electricity and magnetism  

## üìä Features
- Simulation of transformer behavior  
- Calculation of power loss  
- Efficiency analysis  
- Visualization of primary and secondary winding effects  

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-simulation.git
2. Extract the file
3. Open the project_Transformator.m file in MATLAB.
4. Run the simulation to see results and plots.

##Through this project, we learned:

*How transformers work in real applications
*The relationship between winding turns and voltage/current
*How to calculate and interpret transformer efficiency
